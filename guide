############################# Server Basics #############################

# The role of this server. Setting this puts us in KRaft mode
process.roles=broker,controller

# The node id associated with this instance's roles
node.id=1

# The connect string for the controller quorum
controller.quorum.voters=1@192.168.126.129:9093

############################# Socket Server Settings #############################

# The address the socket server listens on.
# Combined nodes (i.e. those with `process.roles=broker,controller`) must list the controller listener here at a minimum.
# If the broker listener is not defined, the default listener will use a host name that is equal to the value of java.net.InetAddress.getCanonicalHostName(),
# with PLAINTEXT listener name, and port 9092.
#   FORMAT:
#     listeners = listener_name://host_name:port
#   EXAMPLE:
#     listeners = PLAINTEXT://your.host.name:9092
listeners=PLAINTEXT://192.168.126.129:9092,CONTROLLER://192.168.126.129:9093
clear
# Name of listener used for communication between brokers.
inter.broker.listener.name=PLAINTEXT

# Listener name, hostname and port the broker or the controller will advertise to clients.
# If not set, it uses the value for "listeners".
advertised.listeners=PLAINTEXT://192.168.126.129:9092,CONTROLLER://192.168.126.129:9093

# A comma-separated list of the names of the listeners used by the controller.
# If no explicit mapping set in `listener.security.protocol.map`, default will be using PLAINTEXT protocol
# This is required if running in KRaft mode.
controller.listener.names=CONTROLLER

# Maps listener names to security protocols, the default is for them to be the same. See the config documentation for more details
listener.security.protocol.map=CONTROLLER:PLAINTEXT,PLAINTEXT:PLAINTEXT,SSL:SSL,SASL_PLAINTEXT:SASL_PLAINTEXT,SASL_SSL:SASL_SSL

# The number of threads that the server uses for receiving requests from the network and sending responses to the network
num.network.threads=3

# The number of threads that the server uses for processing requests, which may include disk I/O
num.io.threads=8

# The send buffer (SO_SNDBUF) used by the socket server
socket.send.buffer.bytes=102400

# The receive buffer (SO_RCVBUF) used by the socket server
socket.receive.buffer.bytes=102400

# The maximum size of a request that the socket will accept (protection against OOM)
socket.request.max.bytes=104857600
